Project Description
A fun web app that detects how many times you yawn in front of your webcam and rates your sleepiness by changing colors and showing funny moods.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People want to know exactly how sleepy they look while watching boring videos or during long meetings â€” because who really tracks yawns these days?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using your webcam and face detection AI, this app counts your yawns in real-time, changes the background color to reflect your sleepiness level, and shows amusing mood icons â€” all just to prove how much you want to nap!
